# VS Code MCP Project Hints

## Project Structure

The VS Code MCP (Model Context Protocol) project consists of two main components:

- `/server`: MCP server implementation that handles protocol communication
- `/extension`: VS Code extension that provides native VS Code integration

## Key Concepts

- MCP (Model Context Protocol): A protocol for AI agents to interact with external tools and services
- The server acts as a bridge between AI agents (like Goose) and VS Code
- The extension provides native VS Code features like diff viewing and file manipulation

## Common Operations

- File changes are staged through the server and reviewed via VS Code diff viewer
- The extension runs on a dynamic port, stored in `ag-VS Code-mcp-extension.port`
- Communication between server and extension happens over TCP socket

## Available Tools

- `create_diff`: Shows file changes in VS Code diff viewer for approval
  - Required params: filePath, newContent
  - Optional params: description
- `check_extension_status`: Verifies VS Code extension is installed and responding
- `get_extension_port`: Gets the current port number for extension communication

## File Locations

- Extension port file: `os.tmpdir()/ag-VS Code-mcp-extension.port` or `/tmp/ag-VS Code-mcp-extension.port`
- Server log file: `server/VS Code-mcp-server-debug.log`

## Best Practices

- Always use absolute paths when working with files
- Handle cleanup of temporary files in both success and error cases
- Provide descriptive titles for diffs to help users understand changes
- Check extension connectivity before attempting operations that require it

## Common Issues

- Extension port file may not exist if extension isn't running
- File paths need to be resolved to absolute paths
- Temporary files should be cleaned up after diff operations

## Environment Variables

- `PROJECTS_BASE_DIR`: Base directory for VS Code projects

## How to solve problems in this codebase

If we are having challenges easily solving a problem, take a moment to reflect on 5 or 6 possible sources of the problem. Then distill those into 1 or 2 of the mostly likely options. Add logs to help prove or disprove these possibilities before you move on to attempting to fix the problem with code.
